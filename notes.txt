atoi:
* skip leading and ending spaces, determine the sign and the value
* skip spaces between sign and value
* pass char * pointer as parameter, p++ in funciton doesn't change the p in calling (main) function
* NULL seems not work to determine the end of a c string. use *p == '\0'
* include <limits> to use numeric_limits<int>::max()
* include <cstdlib> or <stdlib.h> to use exit(EXIT_FAILURE) or EXIT_SUCCESS

climbing stairs:
* include stdlib for atoi
